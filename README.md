### 👋 Hello, visitor

I'm Steven, a software engineer in Berlin who likes to work on meaningful and useful products. In my spare time, I either build some useful tools that might be useful or write a blog article to advertise my tools. I enjoy learning new technologies and using them to solve practical use cases.

#### 👨‍💻 Some projects I have worked on:

- [group-generator](https://github.com/steven-mi/group-generator): Web application to split your list of items in random subgroups.
- [huoguoml](https://github.com/huoguoml/huoguoml): Platform for managing and serving Machine Learning models.
- [push-latest-changes-action](https://github.com/steven-mi/push-latest-changes-action): A GitHub Action for pushing files from one repository to another.
- [newspipe](https://github.com/steven-mi/newspipe): Airflow setup and pipeline for crawling online newspaper article.
- [tfx-gpt2](https://github.com/steven-mi/tfx-gpt2): End-end TFX production pipeline for training and running GPT-2.

In general, I work on quite a few different things and like to explore new techologies.
